# TimesStreams

Overall roadmap:

- Match basic stream visual
- Wrapper index page with project explanation, links to Times
- Chrome extension
- Safari extension

Stream Todo List

- [ ] Show non-Times story sources
- [ ] Add image captions on wide images
- [ ] darker separator between days with date header?
- [ ] infinite scrolling
- [ ] match font?


Note: to run streams locally, cd to that directory and `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
